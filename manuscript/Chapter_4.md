**Jordan Hudgens:** In this section of the course we're going to get into one of the main fundamental concepts that a lot of people think about when they think of user interface and design and that is: branding.

This is a very special topic for me and it's one where I've specifically asked for this one to be included because, to me this gets as close to the design "black magic" as anything that I've ever worked with, because I've been on a number of projects where the client asked me to design them a logo and... we're not going to show any of those.

They are not very good. And it always bothered me that, no matter how hard I tried, it seemed like I was not building something that looked professional. A little bit of it definitely comes down to the inspiration side, because I always was trying to create something completely unique, which is hard to do, period. But it's *really* hard to do with things like logos and those kind of things. But then on top of it, I was missing a very important component. It's one thing that, when you and I sat down and talked about this and you showed me what your process was, I actually got really excited, because what Jesse's going to walk through is showing that designing logos and these kinds of branding components definitely has an art to it but there is also a very heavy science component.

Branding is a big word, right? Whether we're talking specifically about logos or if we're talking about the overall feeling and whether that's being put into an app with the use of color and different branding elements. Or if we're just talking about the name and how this brand is supposed to be perceived. I mean, this could be a three hour long guide just talking about this.

It's definitely heavy into the design side. We're talking about very specific things of designing logos, and like you said, a lot of times, especially when you're freelancing, *you're* the tech guy and they want you to come up with a logo. So knowing a little bit about it is really important. My favorite thing I've ever heard about good branding is to be good storytellers, right? A lot of times if you're doing the branding for a company you think, "I need to make the company look as awesome as possible" when really, and this is what I love so much: You're not making the brand be the hero of the user's story. You're making the users the hero of *their own* story *inside of* this brand. It's really cool.

I mean, you look at car commercials and it's not about just making the car the coolest thing ever, it's that *you're* really cool *inside* the car. Like *you're* the hero, when *you're* using this car, right? So that's a really cool concept of what branding can convey, but you can get very granular into what is the actual specific scientific method and artistic method of establishing a good brand, telling that story, designing logos, and using color.

So with logos they are... pretty frustrating, and also ***really*** gratifying when you get it right and it looks good. It's just awesome. You can go and look at other people's logos and you're just like oh well, duh, like that's so easy. No. Not easy. Take something like the Nike logo, right? And you're like, I can make that in 2 seconds. It's like "Sure. You *could*. After you *looked* at it."

And Nike is actually a really good case study at looking at the differences between a descriptive logo and a distinctive logo. A descriptive logo is going to be a lot better at saying exactly what it is that this brand does. Think Dunkin' Donuts right? Dunkin' Donuts has coffee on it. Burger King has "Burger King" like, inside of the buns, right?

Right.

But Nike's logo isn't a shoe. It's this swoosh. Now what's the swoosh doing? It's conveying motion. It's conveying the *idea* of what Nike is, but not necessarily *what* it is. And that's the difference between a descriptive and a distinctive logo. Sometimes you use one and sometimes you use the other.

If you really look at a lot of popular logos you'll start to identify where it's just like "I can't imagine this brand being anything different, but now that I'm looking at this logo... why did they decide to do this?" Because a lot of times that logo is just being used to establish strength or it's being used to establish wisdom. And you can do that based on how sharp the edges are, or how soft they are, or how thick it is, or how much negative space is inside of it.

There's a couple of really good examples that I can give from my own personal experience. One of them included not only doing the logo but actually doing the name as well. He came to us and he wanted to create these protein supplements that came in these pixie stick style packets for your pre-, intra- and post-workout. So he told us what the product was going to be, and he had an idea for a name and he wanted to call them "Meat Sticks". And we were like... can we try to think of something different?

![](jordan.png)

Haha!

He said "Sure, if you think of anything better." To him, it was like "meat heads" and like, pixie stick things, and it's just like, that's not feeling right.

So we went through a long process of asking questions like, "What are the words associated with this? What are things we want this brand to be associated with?" And that helped drive, not only what we named it, but the logo that we designed. We ended up with a name that used vernacular that people in a gym would commonly use. Instead of "Meat Sticks", the name that we came up with was "Triset."

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/devcamp-pictures/UI+for+Developers/Brand+Development/Logo+Design+Guide+-+Part+1/Triset+Logo+Type.PNG "Triset Logo Type")

It's this process of using these three different individual packets. And you're doing a set of three of them, right? So Triset is actually a really good example of how you can communicate what it's doing, but in a distinctive way where you wouldn't necessarily know right off the bat. And then the logo is really cool.

So the T at the beginning and the end come together and they form the logo, which is a column--establishing that strength that we wanted to communicate. And the logo mark, which would be that column, can be used, and then the logo type, which would be the entire Triset spelled out, can be used as well. So, really good example of taking the idea that a customer wanted and then really conveying the power of that distinction.

##Logo Design Guide - Part 2

When it comes to actually designing the logos, how big of a priority do you put on tasks such as the size that the logos are going to be. So if it goes on a billboard it can be one size or you could have a much larger sized logo with more detail. But then if it also needs to be a smartphone application icon then you can't have very much detail at all or else it looks weird. So how do you kind of draw the line on detail?

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

You definitely need to be designing with the idea that this thing might be put on a blimp one day, or it might be a tiny embroidered emblem. And so keeping in mind how easy this is going to be to use across all these different mediums is important. What else is important is knowing what it's going to look like in different colorways.

If a critical point of the logo relies on having a dark shade and a light shade of red and then that person is incapable of embroidering it and embossing it on things because that has to be a single shade, and now it's like, well, you had it as this really cool circle that looked like it was going into itself with drop shadow and two different shades of red, but now all of a sudden it just looks like a circle. When it's in black and white, it's just a circle. So thinking about the different colorways that it are going to be used is also important.

I usually design in black and white because I want to make sure that it can work inside of that constraint first. And I don't like getting very skeuomorphic, I don't like using a lot of gradients, and things like that for those reasons, again, because if you put a skeuomorphic logo on a shirt you're going have to do a full color print. You can't just do a single color or a dual color.

So I like designing in black and white. And I also like distinctive logos more. They're easier. I don't have to illustrate a coffee cup or anything that, I can do something a little bit simpler. The problem is getting it to accurately convey the mood and message and tell a story. That is more difficult. So this is the science behind it might be a little bit more difficult, but the actual manual design of it would maybe be a little bit easier.

A good example of a logo and brand that we recently did was for Zaplio. Zaplio is a product where it's using a Twilio number and giving it a text message interface because Twilio by default doesn't have a text message interface. We wanted to create something like iMessages using Twilio numbers, which was pretty cool.

For the logo we wanted to communicate that interaction. So, a little bit of descriptive, but also where the logo is simple enough that it can be pretty distinctive as well. And it's important to know that you can have both of those things. So this is where you kind of see some of the science behind what goes into a logo.

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/devcamp-pictures/UI+for+Developers/Brand+Development/Logo+Design+Guide+-+Part+2/Zaplio+Logo+Fibonacci+Overlay.PNG "Zaplio Logo with Fibonacci Overlay")

If you actually look at the guides that I've set around the logo mark, you can see I've got a Fibonacci sequence of circles that are setting all of my different angles and lines and they're not just arbitrarily placed. They all work off of each other. I don't do this with every single logo, but when I can make it work it comes out looking really good.

It might seem like a lot of fuss when you could easily just skip that and still accomplish the same thing, but there are a lot of logos that you probably don't know use this type of grid system. Apple, again, for example.

![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/devcamp-pictures/UI+for+Developers/Brand+Development/Logo+Design+Guide+-+Part+2/Apple+Logo+Fibonacci+Overlay.PNG "Apple Logo with Fibonacci Overlay")

If you look at the Apple logo with those same grids and the Fibonacci sequence you can see like, look at the leaf and how one circle indicates one side and the other circle indicates the other side. It wasn't just an arbitrary angle that they picked for those curves

When you originally showed this to me and then also pointed out how this was done with Apple--and also the new Google logo does the same--that made me as happy as anything in a while because all of a sudden, it was like the curtain got pulled away and I understood why my logos have always been really ugly.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

Hahaha.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

Because, I didn't apply any of those kinds of practices! And it made a lot more sense because there ***is*** a science behind how our eyes see things. They see things that, even if they don't know they're looking for them--such as the Fibonacci sequence--we are, as humans very heavy in pattern matching. And that's just the way our brains work. So when we see things certain types of elements, it's going to make our minds happy. We're going to see something, we're automatically going to like it, even if we don't know why. And it's because that type of work went into it.

That's a huge thing I want you to take from this guide specifically. You may think, if you were like me, you may have just thought that logo design was something that could be done by artists. There definitely is an art component to it, you do have to have that creativity and work on it, but there is much more that goes into that.

There is a science, so there are ways, when you look at some of the best logos that have ever been made they do match those kinds of patterns. So if you're like me and you are not naturally great at creating logos, it might just be because you haven't dug into the science enough yet. That's a personal thing that I'm going to be working on is being able to experiment with that and see if I can finally kind of get past that point a little bit. So I'm excited about that. 

For homework on this one, I definitely recommend that you look through some of the more popular logos out there. See if you can recognize some of these patterns, and then later on in the actual project for this entire course, one of the elements that you're going to be asked to build is your own logo. So that is something to look forward to and I will see you in the next guide.
