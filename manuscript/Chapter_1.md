**Jordan Hudgens:** Hi and welcome to this course on user interface for developers. My name is Jordan Hudgens. And with me is Jesse Cooke the CEO and creative director for the slate development shop.

If you followed along in our user experience course that is where we helped you develop a system for all of the steps needed for building a clean and efficient user interface. And that is a very important component on building an application build whether it be mobile desktop or any type of software system.

Now, in this course, we’re going to take that knowledge and we’re going to extend it into the parts of the system where the users are actually going to be able to see it. So this is everything from colors, white space, all kinds of different components. And one of the reasons why I was very excited about this course is because this is a topic I personally want to learn.

Part of the reason we’re building the course and why Jesse is coming down is this is not a personal strength for me, which is the reason why Jesse is here we want somebody that is specialized has been doing this for years and has had quite a bit of success in implementing these type of techniques.

**Jesse Cooke:** Yeah. What we really want to talk about is to give you guys the best fundamentals to give you guys that low hanging fruit that’s going to really push your ability to design something yourself and not only just design it but also understand the principles that any creative is being delivered to you with so that you can understand how to implement those designs in a pixel-perfect fashion.

So really understanding the thought process that goes behind the typography choices that
goes behind the colors the style guide the balance on the page the better grasp you guys have on understanding those design principles will not only make you more capable of designing these things yourself but they’re also going to make you a lot better of a developer because you’re going to be able to implement designs that are given to you a lot more confidently.

Absolutely. And just before we were filming we’re talking about one of the developers that
works for Slate who also is very good at design. And you’re talking about how with that set of skills, that combination it has made every project he’s work on just turn out very well.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

Yeah, he showed a huge interest in really stepping more into the design realm. You know we
hired him on as a developer and he really showed that he wanted to take a proactive approach to learning the creative direction part. And he’s just been flourishing and it’s been awesome. Not only has he been having a great time like really being able to expand his skill set but the other developers have talked to me. And on the projects that they’ve worked with him, it’s been so smooth because he’s been able to design and understand what that looks like on the development side.

And since he’s the one that’s also implementing a lot of the front end communicating with the back end everything is just going so smoothly because they don’t have to build a bridge to anyone because he’s already there.

![](jordan.png)

Absolutely, that’s something that for my own side one thing that I personally am trying to
improve on myself is in this exact skill because the workflow that I’ve had for the majority of my own career has been working with somebody like yourself and I would always have to wait until I got the mockups the designs everything like that. And it always made it so I was constantly waiting for these things.

For these screens and these designs to be done. And if I could personally be better
on this side of the design and that part of it then that could help make me a better developer because I would know what’s going on and the thought processes behind picking out certain styles and how you design different components. But also I’d be able to do that and go right into development and make the entire process much more efficient.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

Yeah, absolutely it’s definitely something where you shouldn’t be terrified of design and think "Oh I don’t have any design in my in my jeans so I’m not ever going to be able to be a designer." There’s a lot of very basic fundamentals that if you understand those and really practice those and take an active approach to learning how to better implement typography in color and white space it’s going to put you so much farther forward in your ability to design it.

Learning those fundamentals gives you the foundation on which you can really start to actively get better as opposed to just kind of spinning around in circles and designing the same type of stuff and so what we’re going to do is we’re going to really lay that foundation of what you should be thinking about why it’s important.

There are some things that maybe you think don’t carry as much weight in actually why it looks the way it does and you just say “Man, I don’t know why this doesn’t look great but it just doesn’t look great”. So we want to kind of give you some insight as to maybe why it doesn’t look and what you could do to make it look better.

Absolutely. This is, a course, I’m very excited about it. I hope that you get as much from it as I do. And we will see you in the next set of guides.

##How to Create a System for Design Inspiration

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

Hi, and welcome to our guide on inspiration as it applies to a user interface. This
is a really important part of the course because as I’ve gone through other user interface courses and I’ve tried to learn to see what types of things are important to teach but also to learn. This seemed to be a very critical component that seemed to be missing. And so that’s why we’re going into it right away and it’s because whenever I’ve tried to design anything whether it’s a Web site or a logo or anything like that.

One of the hardest steps I have is that first one which is I’ve no idea what to
actually design and when I will speak with a number of other designers they kind of almost skip over that part a little bit. And to me without that you really can’t do anything else.

And so I wanted to talk with you and get kind of what your personal system is for getting inspiration. So when I say I need feature X Y Z on devcamp how do you know that it should be this box with these kinds of rounded edges and where do you place all the components and just kind of talk to how you get those kinds of ideas for the projects you work on.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

Right! Absolutely, this is something that I find a lot of designers are kind of hesitant to
talk about sometimes not with other designers but maybe in a situation like this because it’s almost like you know you’re giving away a little bit of the “secret sauce”. The concept of looking to other work for inspiration is crucial. There’s no reason why that’s how we are getting better at our design than we’re iterating and our design is changing, the way apps look today is different than they looked three years ago. And they’re going to look different three years from now, and everyone is kind of, you know developing and we moved from let’s go back in time six years everything was using what’s called skew morphic design.

If you think of the original iPhone iOS. The notes had the kind of fake leather right over the top you know. Everything looked like it was a digital rendition of a physical item. And so the shading, drop shadow, everything was like really like pseudo-realistic right. And that’s called skew morphism.

All of a sudden that became really outdated. It was iOS 7 when all of a sudden it went totally flat. Like hardly any drop shadows. Everything was flat colors hardly any gradients and there was really jarring for a lot of people outside the design community because inside the design community we already been seeing that happen. We’d been seeing Websites doing that and so then IOS did it and the world was like I don’t like this.

The reason why Steve Jobs wanted the scheme morphic designed first is because people were not used to working on a smartphone. So he wanted a lot of elements of the real world on it. So at least people would feel a little bit safer kind of making that jump into the digital realm. The reason I bring these things up is because design is always changing and it’s going to start communicating to the public in different ways. We didn’t know how to scroll really well when Web sites first came out.

Everyone is shoving all the content above the fold they were putting it in the first 900 pixels because that’s how they did it with newspapers. Right. Newspapers you put all the big stories up on there. And so when we invented Web site it’s like oh this is just kind of a newspaper on a computer. So that’s what people try to do and if you go back in 1998 Website is just got all the things like up before you scroll.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

Absolutely.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

Then you know we’ve now hit 2010. People figured out that you can scroll and then you start seeing a lot more landing pages come up where you can tell a story you know section by section by section. Design continues to change, so you need to be able to go out see what apps are looking like see what Web sites are looking like. So the first thing that I do there’s two really popular Web sites where designers publish their work. They publish it one day to kind of build a following and you know it’s like Instagram but just for designs or others there’s bēhance.net and there’s dribbble.com

They’re both really great. I just bounce back and forth between the both of them. You’re not
necessarily going there to say “I’m going to go and completely mimic another design”. Odds are no one’s really designed the exact application that you’re doing. Maybe sometimes they have and there’s nothing wrong with looking at those and be like oh that’s interesting they put those settings in this way or they took this action in this way that’s totally fine. Sometimes there’s an objective right answer or way to do something and I’ve hit things or I’m just like this is the only right way to do this.

But then there’s a lot of subjectivity in design and so you definitely can kind of pivot and be like I love most of what they did here but there’s a few things that they could have done differently.

From a strictly aesthetic perspective, you’re going in and you’re looking at you know what kind of color palette are these people using. You don’t need to reinvent the wheel for a lot of these things so if I’m designing an application and the application has a list with profile photos on the left and some metadata on the right.

Do you know how many times that’s been designed? Like just an index of objects.
So many times. So go and look and be like OK do I go a really strong and dark name like username and then like a light colored thin font off to the right. Or do I make them both thin or do I make this blue so that I know that I can click it. So there’s a lot of different decisions you can make. As opposed to saying this is the only way that you’re going to do this going forward.

No, it’s about the process. So the first thing you should do when you know the type of things that need design you’ve already gotten through the user experience a lot of times this helps in the user experience as well. Like forgot password. Can you immediately think of all the screens that need to exist for a Forgot Password? Do you click and then it says an e-mail link is on the way or does it say Hey we just texted you a code and here is this. What’s that exact process? Go grab your phone, log out of Facebook and then click forgot password and see how they do it.

See how all these other apps are doing it. Because then you’re getting really good user experience right there. “Oh, that’s a huge pain I had to open my mail on my phone or on my desktop. No, I like the text version better”.

It’s such a benefit don’t ignore that, to be able to test things out and that’ll just help you kind of get forward and you’re not. I mean that’s just the right way to do it.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

Absolutely, and with that when you know the application you’re building and the feature set
that’s definitely one part of it. Do you find that when you are not actually going and you don’t have a specific project in mind do you still just to continually learn and find new things? Are you still going to those websites just to look out of curiosity?

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

Yeah it’s like Instagram right.? It’s like a social network, and even more so you know I have a bookmark folder, and whenever I’m on any website and I like something that they did I’ll bookmark it.

I’m like. “Oh man, I really like how they showed this testimonial”. The next time I’m designing the Web site I’m going to come and look at this testimonial, right? So I’m always saving stuff that I like. I take pictures of patterns I like out in the real world. I'm thinking "Oh, this could be a cool background pattern." Definitely, when I see apps that I really like the design, a perfect example is Venmo versus the cash app, by Square. Two very different interfaces. And personally I just love the cash app and so I use it because that’s the design I like. But you can compare that and you can be like OK you know Venmo is going for this and cash is going for this.

Why? They obviously maybe made a decision of why to do this type of design and why they did this type of design. You’re just constantly adding to that mental portfolio especially because a big tool you have to solve problems both in user experience but also definitely in user interface is precedence.

Whenever you hit a point it’s so helpful if you have a problem like “How am I going to design that?” if you’ve just got something logged in your head. It’s just like oh I know snap chat does something like this. And you can go to that and you can look at the precedents and you can see if that worked well or worked poorly. It gives you just like such a foothold and you’re not just like spinning your tires all the time.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

That’s huge. That’s one of the biggest points on why I wanted to include this guide in the entire course and to me this is actually one of the most important things that everyone will take away from the course because I personally feel especially when I was younger and I was really struggling with coming up with design ideas because there would be so many times I’d be the only developer on a project which I did do everything, not just the web application but also the logo and the color scheme and everything.

I always had this mindset that I needed in order to build a good design it all needed to be done from scratch. It had to be a one of a kind. I couldn’t look at anything else. This had to be just something that came out of nothing.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

Yeah.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

And that never turned out well.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

You know we haven’t even talked about that. You know there are the apples of the world and those types of people. They have a lot of thought processes and they spent tens of millions of dollars in researching what makes a good user interface and to simply ignore that is irresponsible.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

It really is.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

Learning from all of the work that’s been done by people who’ve been doing this for a very long time. That’s a very critical component of it. And if we skip past that we’re constantly going to be running into the same problems over and over again where we just kind of get stuck and can’t really build something that feels professional.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

Right, take for example Snapchat. Then all of a sudden Facebook comes out with a very
similar feature on Instagram and then adds that live streaming to its Facebook platform or the live streaming on Facebook, compare that to Meerkat or periscope things like that. They look extremely similar. Why? Because there’s a lot of objectively correct ways to do things in there.

It’s like they’re going to look really similar because to make it look different would just make it worse. There’s just certain things, think about whether we just have hearts come up underneath or do we have comments that also come up underneath.

If you look at Facebook live streaming and Periscope it’s really close. Facebook has come over from the right and Periscope had them come up from underneath. It’s so nuanced and close but it’s like how else are you supposed to do it. There’s nothing wrong with looking at how other people are doing it and then making a decision is that the right way. Is that the wrong way. Is there a subjectively different way that could be just as good? Yeah! But if you’re not even looking at it because you’re scared that you may be copying something then you’re doing yourself a huge disservice.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

I think that is 100% accurate. Some homework for you as students going through this is before you even go on to the next guide. I definitely recommend for you to go to a few of those applications like dribbble and be hands-on with these so that you can start to see what’s out there. When Jesse originally showed those to me I was absolutely fascinated.

Because that was not really the part of the world I dove into.  It was like all of these different screens and concepts of very talented designers are coming up with, those are things I could learn from and those are things that like you said you can develop that mental portfolio those things that whenever I start to think about a new feature or some new page that I need to create all of a sudden I’m not starting from scratch I’m able
to leverage what I’ve learned from others especially others that have been doing that for a very long time.

Have fun looking at those sites and we’ll see you in the next guide.
